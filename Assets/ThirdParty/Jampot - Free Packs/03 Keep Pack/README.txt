  Jampot  —  Keep Pack
  A matched set of stylised, hand-painted-look 3D environment props.
========================================================================

Thank you for picking up the pack! Everything you need is in this folder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT'S INSIDE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
One cohesive Keep building kit — every prop shares the same palette and
finish so they drop into a scene together. Included piece families:

  Door · Window · Wall (straight / corner / floor) · Fence (straight /
  corner / gate) · Terrain (flat / slope / cliff / corner) · Furniture ·
  Bench · Light Pole · Barrels (closed / open / stack) · Crates (closed /
  open / stack)

Every piece is a separate model with a clean, upright, origin-on-the-floor
transform and a flat-colour stylised PBR material (base colour + roughness;
no texture files to wrangle — the look is in the material).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLDERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  production-ready/
    FBX/   Every piece as .fbx (Y-up) + Keep_FullBuild.fbx (the whole kit).

TECH SPECS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Style               Keep  (pack 03 of the Jampot series)
  Pieces              21 individual props
  Scale               Real-world — 1 Blender unit = 1 metre.
  Orientation         GLB & FBX: Y-up   ·   .blend: Z-up (Blender native)
  Origins             Every piece centred at the origin, base on the floor (Z=0), identity transform.
  Materials           One flat-colour Principled/PBR material per surface.
                      Metallic 0 except where a piece is genuinely metal;
                      the stylised look lives in the base colour + roughness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENGINE NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  UNITY   Import the FBX, material Standard/URP-Lit, scale factor 1.
  UNREAL  Import the GLB (or FBX) — real-world scale, drop-in materials.
  GODOT   Drag the .glb in — materials come through automatically.
  WEB     GLB is self-contained — ideal for Three.js / Babylon / Sketchfab.
